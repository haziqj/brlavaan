# Retrieve the true values of the models used for simulation

Retrieve the true values of the models used for simulation

## Usage

``` r
truth_growth(rel, scale = 1)

truth_twofac(rel, meanstructure = FALSE, scale = 1)

truth(x)
```

## Arguments

- rel:

  Reliability of the growth curve model. Either 0.8 or 0.5.

- scale:

  Scaling factor for the data. Default is 1, but for the growth curve
  model data, it is found that having a smaller scale (1/10) can be
  beneficial for convergence.

- meanstructure:

  Logical (this is almost always `FALSE`). If `TRUE`, include the mean
  structure in the estimation. Only for two-factor models (since growth
  models do not have a mean structure).

- x:

  A data frame generated by
  [`gen_data_growth()`](https://haziqj.ml/brlavaan/reference/gen-data.md)
  or
  [`gen_data_twofac()`](https://haziqj.ml/brlavaan/reference/gen-data.md).

## Value

A named numeric vector with the true values of the model.

## Examples

``` r
truth_growth(0.8)
#> i~~i  i~1 s~~s  s~1 i~~s    v    v    v    v    v    v    v    v    v    v 
#>  550    0  100    0   40  500  500  500  500  500  500  500  500  500  500 
truth_twofac(0.5)
#> fx=~x2 fx=~x3 fy=~y2 fy=~y3  fy~fx x1~~x1 x2~~x2 x3~~x3 y1~~y1 y2~~y2 y3~~y3 
#>   0.70   0.60   0.70   0.60   0.25   1.00   0.49   0.36   1.00   0.49   0.36 
#> fx~~fx fy~~fy 
#>   1.00   1.00 
```
