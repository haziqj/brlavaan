# To discuss

1. Run through how the functions work.

  - How to fit xRBM models.
  - What does the `expand_theta()` and `contract_theta()` do?
  - [Confirmed âœ…]  Implementation is the same as @okemp99. 
  - The `hessian_loglik()` returns the matrix of second derivatives, so I did not stick a minus in there (it's not the observed information if evaluated at theta hat)
  - Scaling... I coded the e and j matrices to be full information matrices, and not unit matrices.

2. Constrained optimisation. Not yet implemented. Plan to stick the correct bounds for `nlminb()`.

3. Equality constraints, using indices.

4. Discuss some results (toy example)

----

- Can we replace Hessian with expected information? And the thing about small parts in the Hessian (zero).
