# Discussion

1. Method name. RBM = Reduced bias M-estimator. I guess it should be "Bias reduced estimator" or BRM as in "bias-reduced method" or "bias-reduced MLE".

2. Looking at the convergence failures, using expected information is much more stable. 
  	
3. Not clear yet which plugin penalty to use.

# For next meeting

1. a. using nlminb (hard penalty)
   b. "soft penalty" if theta approaches the bounds, then return 1e-40
