# Discussion

1.  New way of using pack/unpack to deal with constraints.

-   Check that this is correct
-   Standard errors still not correct (with/without constraints)
-   Why warning NA/NaN eval at the start of nlminb?

2.  From last meeting -- Can we replace Hessian with expected information? And the thing about small parts in the Hessian (zero)? In small samples, jinv is not stable.

# For next meeting

1. Haziq to fix the standard errors for pack/unpack code, and re-run simulations.

2. Ollie & Ioannis will code the growth curve model by hand, to check against Haziq's codebase.

3. Worthwhile investigating replacing Hessian with expected information in simulations.

4. Meeting scheduled on 4th November 2024.
