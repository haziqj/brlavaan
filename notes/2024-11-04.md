# Discussion

1. Haziq fixed the pack/unpack code and also standard errors.

2. Ollie coded manually and tested against Haziq's code
		- Growth model ✅
  		- Two factor model ❌ 
  		- All components OK (loglik, gradients, hessian, penalty) but   the resulting fit is not OK 
  	
3. Yves added these:
  	- loglik() has RBM and plugin.penalty arguments
	- we check explicitly for non-positive definite Sigma
	- we check for non-convergence (and return NAs)
	- we print out the loglik/rbm/plugin.penalty terms at each iteration
	- for iRBM and iRBMp, we use EXPECTED information (only for numerical reasons)

Seems that RBM term explodes, and leads to non-convergence. Hessian non p.d. -- but works numerically with EXPECTED information.

4. [YVES] As for the growth curve model, the plugin penalty does not make much sense (to me). Some variances need to be >500, so shrinking them down towards zero is perhaps too brutal.
