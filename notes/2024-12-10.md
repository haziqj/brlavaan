# Discussion

1. Penalty functions.

  a. Ridge penalty (basic L2 penalty)
  b. Ridge penalty with bounds
  c. Huber penalty with bounds (or just left-bounded)
  d. Frobenius norm to target matrix

2. lavaan changes to using bounds and simple equality constraints simultaneously.

3. How to implement Frobenius norm penalty in lavaan? Two ingredients:
  
  a. The target matrix can be obtained using code from https://osf.io/d53t9 
  b. The current Sigma matrix is computed in the loglikelihood function already

# For next meeting

1. Decided to split the paper into two parts:
  
  a. Introducing the concept of RBM (explicit and implicit) for SEM, and comparing performance to previous D&R paper.
  b. Emphasis on plugin penalties to improve stability of estimates.
  
2. Haziq to prepare draft manuscript template so everyone can contribute writing.

3. Next meeting in early January.
